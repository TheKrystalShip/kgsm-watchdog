## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- `GET /players` endpoint: returns all instances' live player sessions as a JSON object keyed by
  instance name. Each session carries `sessionKey`, `id`, `name`, `addr`. Used by kgsm-api on
  startup to reconcile roster status without waiting for events.
- `PlayerSessionStore` — thread-safe DI singleton wrapping per-instance `PlayerSessionMap`s.
  Extracted from `NativePlayerPresenceIngester` so the control surface can read the session map
  while the ingester writes. The ingester now delegates `Join`/`Leave`/`Reset` to the store.

### Changed
- `NativePlayerPresenceIngester` no longer owns per-instance `PlayerSessionMap`s directly — they
  live in the shared `PlayerSessionStore`. The `NativeWatch` record no longer carries a `Sessions`
  field. No behavioral change to event emission.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Initial versioned release.
