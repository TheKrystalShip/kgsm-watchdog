# Sourced by BOTH deploy/setup.sh (the one-shot privileged host provisioning) and

# exactly once, so the two entry points can never disagree about what this project installs.
#
# The canonical source of this pattern is tks/scripts/deploy-template/ — see its README for the
# contract. This copy is vendored so a standalone kgsm-watchdog clone deploys with no umbrella
# checkout present. Keep everything below the PROJECT BLOCK in step with the template.
#
# Not executable on its own.

# This file only DEFINES things; every variable below is consumed by the two scripts that
# source it, which shellcheck cannot see from here.
